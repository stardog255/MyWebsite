	<h1 class ="display-3">ADDIE Model</h1>
	<p>The ADDIE Model is the most prevelant and used model of Instructional design models.There are five distinctive phases in the ADDIE Model. The ADDIE model is similar to traditional waterfall system development lifecycle for systems and software. 
	<p>The ADDIE Model is considered controverisal because in recent years technology and the development process has changed greatly, and as such rapid and agile methodologies have gained popularity because of their flexability and non-linear approach. Therefore many branches of the ADDIE model have morphed and come into exsistence because of its structured methodology. </p>
		
	  <ul>
		 <li>Analysis Phase</li>
		 <li>Design Phase</li>
		 <li>Development Phase</li>
		 <li>Implemetationn Phase</li>
		 <li>Evaluation Phase</li>
	    </ul>
	  
		<br>	    
		<p><strong>Analysis Phase</strong> - is an important part of the ADDIE model because since ADDIE is stuctured and linear analyst and designers establish goals and problems the instuctors and sharehodlers phase. Analyst must find and address potential constraints, issues, and problems that may exist in the analysis because if these issue are not dealt with in analysis they could result in redesign and could greatly inflate cost of the project. </p>
	    <p><strong>Design Phase</strong> - the design phase is an important phase because this where the design of the application is created this will include instruction, media, content, and integration of theories and concepts. The design phase is systematic in concept so this means the application is developed in a logical manner and encompasses stragies, goals and learning concepts for the application</p>
		<p><strong>Development Phase</strong> - Development phase is where desginers, instructors and programmers come together to develope working models of the applications. This procsess includes storayboarding, design, graphics, and content put together by the development team. The application is created and tested and debugged where it's final stage is ready for implementation</p>
		<p><strong>Implementation Phase</strong> -Implementation Phase is a transition of a ready product into the production environment or the launch of a stand alone application. This phase oftern invovles traning and or trainers instucting end-users on using the system. The Implementation team will gather the feedback from users through various tools such as surveys to helpful feedback about the usablity of the application </p>
		<P><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong> - Evaluation Phase uses two methodlogies formative and summative evaluation.  Formative evaluation is used in each of the phases and is a tool used in each phase independently. The summative evluation is the summation of the project using the ADDIE Model. </P>
